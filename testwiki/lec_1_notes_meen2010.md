## Syllabus and about this class

* Exams might be pushed back
* The class will be slightly compressed
     
* Homework solutions will be posted:
    * Make sure you use these for feedback!

* Submit homework on gradescope or canvas
* Weekly assessments (short andswer and multiple choice to make sure you're keeping up
    
* Using the textbook effectively. They are good study tools:
    * At end of section, see *important points* and *Analysis Procedures*
    * *Fundamental Problems* included with partial solns and answers in the back
    * *Chapter Review* covers main points of chapter

## Intro to mechanical engineering and the topics in the class

- [ ] Q: What is mechanical engineering? @[00:07:30]
- [ ] Q: What is statics vs dynamics @[00:08:10]

* Some idealized assumptions we'll make:
    * Particles (have mass but size doesn't matter)
    * Concentrated forces (don't deform things). They act on a single point
    * Rigid bodies


* IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS: Use *5 significant figures during calculations*, result is given with *3 significant figures*

- [ ] Q: What is a force vector?
- [ ] Q: What is the geometric interpretation of $scalar * vector$? @~[00:21:00]
- [ ] Q: What is the geometric interpretation of $vector + vector$?
- [ ] Q: What is the geometric interpretation of $vector - vector$? @[00:22:30]

- [ ] Q: What is the law of sines?
- [ ] Q: What is the law of cosines?  TODO: look up formula and write here
- [ ] Q: When to use law of of sines vs law of cosines? TODO: look up formula and write here

- [ ] Law of sines & cosines example problems @[00:27:00-end]

## Q & A

- [ ] Q: What is mechanical engineering? @[00:07:30]
    * A: Engineering that has to do with *mechanics* -- the physics of movement and forces
- [ ] Q: What is statics vs dynamics @[00:08:10]
    * A: Static systems are not moving and forces are at equilibrium. Forces w/o motion vs forces w/ motion
- [ ] Q: What is a force vector?
    * A: A force that is exerted that has a magnitude and direction. All forces are vectors.
- [ ] Q: What is the geometric interpretation of $scalar * vector$? @~[00:21:00]
    * A: Imagine the same vector pointing in the same direction, except its magnitude (length) is *scaled* by the scalar.
- [ ] Q: What is the geometric interpretation of $vector + vector$?
    * A: Imagine triangle/parallelogram rule
- [ ] Q: What is the geometric interpretation of $vector - vector$? @[00:22:30]
    * A: flip the direction of the second vector (*-1) and then add them with parallelogram rule

- [ ] Q: What is the law of sines?
    A: Let a, b, c be sides and A, B, C be angles of an oblique 
    (non-right) triangle. Then, 
    $(a/sinA) = (b/sinB) = (c/sinC)$
- [ ] Q: What is the law of cosines?
    A: let a,b,c be sides and G be angle (between a and b) of an oblique triangle. Then,
    
    $c^1 = a^2 + b^2 - 2*a*b*cos(G)$
    
    This can be rotated. Let A and B be angles following the same "between rule"
    
    $a^2 = b^2 + c^2 -2bc*cos(A)$
    ba^2 = a^2 + c^2 -2ac*cos(B)$

- [ ] Q: When to use law of of sines vs law of cosines?
    * A: Use law of cosines when you have information about the sides. Use law of sines when you have a lot of angles (I think)
