## About

    This page is dedicated to Mechanical Engineering 2010: Statics. I took this
    class during the summer of 2020.
    
    During this class, I will be taking notes in a somewhat unusual manner.
    During lectures, I will write down the material he teaches in the form of
    questions, along with a timestamp indicating when in the video he taught
    the info. I will then use these questions to test my understanding to allow
    for recall-based studying--which has been shown in many studies to be a more
    effective form of studying than simply reviewing material. I may also try to
    write down the answers in the notes and use text-folding to hide the answers.
